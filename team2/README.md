Team 2 Instructions
-------------------

This subdirectory contains a program that will generate prime numbers and
save them in an output.txt file.

However, there is a problem.  See if you can spot the problem in the
output.txt file.

You will probably find that you will be assisted by running the generator
program again.  (If your computer doesnt have python installed, and thus
cannot run the program, try your best to manually find the problem and fix
it - but dont spend more than a couple of minutes)
